The adoption of gender quotas in early 1990s substantively increased the number of elected women at the Argentine Congress (Jones 1996; Lubertino 2003; Alles 2007). However, those quotas were not enforceable in province-level elections. The flexible Argentine federalism allows each province to set its own electoral institutions, and provinces introduced quite different versions of quotas: some adopted more loose requirements, some enforced more strict ones, some introduced them many years later (Caminotti 2014). Overall, the difussion of gender quotas resulted in a larger presence of women: the number of female legislators in province-level assemblies went from an average of 6.1% in 1990, to an average of 28.9% in 2016 (Barnes and Jones 2018).

While there is an extended consensus about the effects of quotas, this chapter leverages on hundreds of provincial elections and thousands of elected legislators to show how the political context shapes the electoral opportunities of women: not only quotas are more favorable to female candidates, but also larger party delegations and larger district magnitudes increase the chances of electing women. Moreover, evidence indicates that provincial female candidates find potential allies at the national level: a larger number of women in Congress is associated with larger chances of women elected in provincial assemblies at their home districts. Contrary, there is little evidence of the influence of frequently mentioned elements of the social context–such as egalitarian social values, higher participation in the labor force, or higher levels of education.

This repository includes data and scripts to replicate model results of the book chapter. Data covers province-level legislative renovations in the 24 constituencies, between 1983 and 2017, for both lower and upper legislative chambers.
